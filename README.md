**A comprehensive, production-ready Reflex web application framework with AI-powered features, enterprise user management, and Mantine UI components.**

Appkit is a full-featured web application framework built on [Reflex](https://reflex.dev) that combines modular, reusable components with production-grade infrastructure. It serves as both a functional application and a showcase for building robust Python web applications with AI integrations, multi-tenant support, and professional UI patterns.

---

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.12 or higher
- PostgreSQL (for development)

### Installation

Clone and install the development environment:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/jenreh/appkit.git
cd appkit

# Install dependencies with uv (includes all workspace components)
uv sync

# Run migrations
alembic upgrade head

# Start the development server
reflex run
```

Access the application at `http://localhost:3000`

### Using Individual Components

To use appkit-mantine in your own Reflex project:

```bash
# Using uv
uv add appkit-mantine

# Using pip
pip install appkit-mantine
```

```python
import reflex as rx
import appkit_mantine as mn

class DemoState(rx.State):
    value: str = ""

def index() -> rx.Component:
    return rx.container(
        mn.input(
            placeholder="Type something...",
            value=DemoState.value,
            on_change=DemoState.set_value,
        ),
    )

app = rx.App()
app.add_page(index)
```

## 📚 Development

### Common Commands

```bash
# Install dependencies
make install

# Run the development server
make reflex

# Run with debug logging
make reflex-debug

# Run tests
make test

# Format and lint code
make format
make lint

# Database operations
make db-migrate          # Run migrations
make db-migrate-history  # Show migration history
make db-migrate-down     # Downgrade one revision
```

### Database Setup

Appkit uses SQLAlchemy 2.0 with Alembic for migrations:

```bash
# Run all pending migrations
uv run alembic upgrade head

# Create new migration
uv run alembic revision --autogenerate -m "Description of changes"

# View current migration status
uv run alembic current
```

### Configuration

Environment-specific configurations are in `configuration/`:

- `config.yaml` - Default configuration
- `config.local.yaml` - Local development overrides
- `config.docker_test.yaml` - Docker test environment
- `logging.yaml` - Logging configuration

Set `APP_ENV` to load specific configs:

```bash
export APP_ENV=local
reflex run
```

---

## 🐳 Docker Support

Build and run the application in Docker:

```bash
# Build the container
docker build -t appkit .

# Run with compose
docker-compose up

# The application will be available at http://localhost
```

The Docker setup includes:

- Multi-stage build for optimized images
- Caddy reverse proxy for static file serving
- Automatic database migrations on startup
- Production-optimized Reflex export

---

## 🔐 Security Considerations

- Credentials are managed through environment variables and never committed to source control
- Sensitive MCP server headers are encrypted in the database
- OAuth2 tokens use secure session management
- Database connections use SSL/TLS in production
- PKCE is enforced for OAuth2 flows

> **Tip:** Review security considerations when deploying to production. Use a secrets management service like Azure Key Vault or AWS Secrets Manager.

- **[Configuration](./configuration)** - Environment and application settings
- **[Database Migrations](./alembic/versions)** - Schema evolution history

## 🤝 Architecture Highlights

### Inheritance-Based Component Design

All Mantine input components inherit from `MantineInputComponentBase`, providing 40+ common properties without duplication:

```python
# Only define component-specific props
class NumberInput(MantineInputComponentBase):
    tag = "NumberInput"
    min: Var[int | float] = None
    max: Var[int | float] = None
    decimal_scale: Var[int] = None
    # label, placeholder, required, etc. inherited automatically
```

### MCP Server Integration

Appkit includes enterprise-grade Model Context Protocol support with secure credential management:

```python
# Manage MCP servers with automatic encryption/decryption
mcp_server = MCPServer(
    name="my-server",
    url="sse://localhost:3000",
    auth_type="headers",
    auth_config={...}  # Automatically encrypted
)
```

### Multi-Tenant User Management

Built-in support for organizations, projects, and role-based access:

```python
# OAuth2 login with automatic profile creation
user = await authenticate_oauth(provider="github", code=code)
# Profile automatically includes role and organization context
```

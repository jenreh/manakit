"""Servlet-filter-style session guard for Reflex WebSocket events.

This is the primary gate. It runs as a ``reflex.middleware.Middleware`` and is
consulted *before* the event's handler is resolved, so returning a non-``None``
``StateUpdate`` short-circuits the whole pipeline: ``on_load_internal`` never
runs, a protected page's ``on_load`` handlers never fire, and no page data is
fetched or serialised into a delta.

That ordering is the security property. The redirect that accompanies the
denial is *not* atomic — an ``ssr: false`` SPA still mounts the target route for
roughly one frame before the client processes the redirect — so an empty shell
may flash. Safety comes from NOT SENDING THE DATA, not from the redirect.

THREAT MODEL — read before relying on this for authorization. The route the
filter checks is ``state.router.url.path``, which Reflex builds from the
``asPath`` field of the client's own ``router_data`` (``RouterData`` at
reflex/istate/data.py; only ``pathname`` is normalized server-side, into
``route_id``). A crafted socket client can therefore declare ``asPath:
"/login"`` and have any event treated as public.

That is not a regression — before this filter existed, directly emitted events
were not gated at all — and it does not expose page data, because
``on_load_internal`` resolves its handlers from the *same* client value, so a
spoofed public path loads the public page's handlers. But it does mean this
filter stops an unauthenticated *browser*, not a determined attacker crafting
socket frames. Per-handler authorization remains the enforcing layer: keep using
:func:`appkit_user.authentication.decorators.is_authenticated` and
:func:`~appkit_user.authentication.decorators.requires_admin` on protected event
handlers. Closing the gap properly means gating on the event's target state
class instead of on any client-declared path.

Known limitation: a short-circuit emits no delta, so the ``redirect_to`` the
denial records on :class:`LoginState` lives only server-side. That is enough for
the usual flow (the bounce to ``/login`` is a client-side navigation, which does
not re-hydrate), but a hard refresh in between makes the browser push its stale
``login_redirect_to`` back and the user lands on the homepage after logging in
instead of the page they asked for.
